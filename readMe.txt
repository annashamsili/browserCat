Instructions
Install:
	1.	Unzip the folder (maybe save it somewhere else than downloads if you tend to clean out your downloads folder)
	2.	Go to chrome://extensions/, and make sure that developer mode (top right corner) is on
	3.	In the top left, click “pack extension”
	4.	Select the folder in the first field and done
	5.	Back on the extensions page, select “load unpacked” on the top left and select the folder again

Play
The first thing you will do is set the name of the cat - this cannot be changed. (Due to design decisions, try choosing one below 10 characters). 
Close the extension and open it again to show the name <3 

To feed the cat, click the cat bowl (left of the cat)
To stroke the cat, click the cat. 
To play with the cat, click the yarn bowl in front of it. 

You gain a heart with each actions, and max have 5 hearts at a time. Hearts elapse after 12 hours. 

Note: This is the first pixel game I have made and when testing it there were some slight glitches - I hope it doesn’t detract too much, and in my experience they go away when you close and reopen the extension!
