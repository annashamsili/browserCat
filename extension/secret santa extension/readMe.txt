Dear Ellen, 

Merry Christmas! 

I took a big risk with this Secret Santa present, because I about 3/4ths way through realised you might not use Google Chrome. This present is a Google Chrome extension - so if you do not use Google Chrome I am going to make the very annoying ask for you to download it (just once, so you can at least see what I made!). I didn’t dare shipping anything, so I thought that by making something like this, I could make sure it arrived in time. 

This extension is a small browser friend, not really a game, but a very low-tech version of a tamagotchi maybe. When I drew your name I immediately had the idea of a pixel game, and I think (?) you like cats - so I really hope you enjoy it at least somewhat!

Have fun with your new little browser friend. 

Love, 
Your Clique Secret Santa

Instructions
Install:
	1.	Unzip the folder (maybe save it somewhere else than downloads if you tend to clean out your downloads folder)
	2.	Go to chrome://extensions/, and make sure that developer mode (top right corner) is on
	3.	In the top left, click “pack extension”
	4.	Select the folder in the first field and done
	5.	Back on the extensions page, select “load unpacked” on the top left and select the folder again

Play
The first thing you will do is set the name of the cat - this cannot be changed. (Due to design decisions, try choosing one below 10 characters). 
Close the extension and open it again to show the name <3 

To feed the cat, click the cat bowl (left of the cat)
To stroke the cat, click the cat. 
To play with the cat, click the yarn bowl in front of it. 

You gain a heart with each actions, and max have 5 hearts at a time. Hearts elapse after 12 hours. 

Note: This is the first pixel game I have made and when testing it there were some slight glitches - I hope it doesn’t detract too much, and in my experience they go away when you close and reopen the extension!
